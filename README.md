- **Category-Based Filtering:** Selecting a blog's category displays all posts related to that category on a new page.
  
- **Hashtag Navigation:** Clicking on hashtags shows blogs associated with those tags.
  
- **React Hooks:** Utilized hooks like ***useState***, ***useEffect***, ***useLocation***, ***useNavigate***, ***useContext***, and ***Routes*** for seamless navigation and state management.
